## üß™ Testing

## üßëüèª‚Äçüè´ How to Use

- Make sure to follow the [Installation](#-installation) steps first.

- Add a `.env` file in the `backend` directory of the project with the following variables (replace the values with your own):

```bash
PORT=8000
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<your_username>:<your_password>@cluster0.ls7js.mongodb.net/Roammate?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
AMADEUS_API_KEY="<Your Amadeus API Key>"
AMADEUS_API_SECRET="<Your Amadeus API Secret>"
JWT_SECRET="<A secret string to use for hashing JWT tokens>"
```

#### Run the Backend:

```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

Once started, the backend server will be accessible at http://localhost:8000. This is where all API requests will be handled.

#### Run the Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend application will run at http://localhost:5173. Open this URL in your browser to interact with the application's user interface.
